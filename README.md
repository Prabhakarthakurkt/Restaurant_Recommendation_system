# Location-Based Recommendations
# Recommendation systems are widely utilized in different applications for predicting the preference or rating of a user 
# in a product or service. Most likely you have come across or interacted with some type of recommender systems in the past 
# few minutes or hours in your online presence.
# These Recommender systems can be of different types and the most prominent ones include Content-based filtering and Collaborative
# filtering. In this article, we will study location-based recommendations, where we specifically focus on geographic locations to render 
# more relevant recommendations utilizing the location of the users.

# To illustrate the crucial aspects of location-based recommenders we will perform a simple Location-based recommendation using the
#  K-Means algorithm with Yelp Dataset from Kaggle.
